# Write Things!

*Write Things!* is an app for writers that helps with writers' block in a carrot-on-a-stick sort of way. You'll get a new picture every few words you write. You can select how often you'd like the app to do this. 

The app uses the [Notion SDK](https://github.com/makenotion/notion-sdk-js) for authentication. After logging in, users can save their writing to their Notion.
